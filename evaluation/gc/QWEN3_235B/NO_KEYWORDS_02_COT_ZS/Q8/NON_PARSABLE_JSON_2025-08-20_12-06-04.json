Ist das nicht möglich, gib einen Fehler zurück.\nThe relevant keywords from the user query \"Meine Tochter und ich fahren Boot auf einem See\" are:\n- Tochter\n- Ich\n- Fahren\n- Boot\n- See\nThese are scene elements and activities and thus valid for GraphCode creation.\n\nTask 2: Löse relative Verweise auf und merke dir diese für die späteren Relationen.\n- \"Meine Tochter\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! refers to the daughter of the user. Since the user is Maria, this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! means \"Maria\u0027s daughter\".\n- \"Ich\" refers to the user, so we replace it with \"Maria\".\n\nTask 3: Übersetze die ermittelten Stichwörter ins Englische.\n- Tochter → daughter\n- Ich → Maria (personal identification, but grammatically: I — but per rule we use \"Maria\")\n- Fahren → drive (but contextually \"boat\" as activity; \"fahren Boot\" means \"go boating\")\n- Boot → boat\n- See → lake\n\nBut \"fahren Boot\" is an activity meaning \"boating\" or \"go boating\", so the verb is \"boat\", and \"Boot\" is the object.\n\nSo updated:\n- Activity: boat\n- Object: boat (the vessel)\n- Object: lake\n- Object: Maria\n- Object: daughter (Maria\u0027s daughter)\n\nTask 4: Ersetze in den potenziellen Stichwörtern die Identifikation des Nutzers, wenn die Person auf den Anfragensteller referenziert (\"ich\", \"mein\", \"mir\").\n- \"Ich\" → \"Maria\"\n- \"Meine Tochter\" → \"Maria\u0027s daughter\"\n\nSo entities:\n1. Maria\n2. Maria\u0027s daughter\n3. boat (vehicle)\n4. lake\n5. boat (activity)\n\nWait — \"boat\" is both an object and an activity.\n\nBut in GraphCode, we can distinguish using types.\n\nSo vocabulary entries:\n- \"Maria\"\n- \"Maria\u0027s daughter\"\n- \"boat\" (as object)\n- \"lake\"\n- \"boat\" (as activity)\n\nBut we should avoid duplication. However, per semantics, the activity of boating is separate.\n\nBut the phrase \"fahren Boot\" means \"to boat\", so \"boat\" as a verb.\n\nAccording to rule: Verallgemeinere Wortstämme → use base form: \"boat\" (verb)\n\nSo the activity is \"boat\".\n\nNow Task 5: Erkläre die Attributeigenschaften.\nWe have:\n- \"Maria\" — this is a person, likely an object (in the sense of an entity)\n- \"Maria\u0027s daughter\" — also a person, object\n- \"boat\" — object (the vessel)\n- \"lake\" — object (location)\n- \"boat\" (activity) — activity\n\nBut we need to map to the given type codes.\n\nGiven type codes:\n1: object (identityMapping\u003dtrue)\n2: context (identityMapping\u003dtrue)\n3: synonym (identityMapping\u003dtrue)\n4: activity (identityMapping\u003dtrue)\n5: attached (identityMapping\u003dfalse)\n6: under (relational)\n7: above\n8: perform (identityMapping\u003dfalse) — connects subject to activity\n9: target (identityMapping\u003dfalse)\n10: daughter (identityMapping\u003dfalse) — this could link parent to child\n14: characteristic (identityMapping\u003dfalse)\n\nSo:\n- Individuals and entities → \"object\"\n- Activity → \"activity\"\n- Relationships:\n  - \"Maria\" is the parent of \"Maria\u0027s daughter\" → use \"daughter\" relation (ID 10) — but note: \"daughter\" relation means \"X daughter Y\" → Y is daughter of X?\nWait, attribute is \"daughter\", so likely: if entry (i,j) has type 10, it means i is the daughter of j? Or j is the daughter of i?\n\nBut the id says \"daughter\", and in context, we need to define direction.\n\nLet\u0027s assume the matrix entry [i][j] \u003d X means: i has relation X to j.\n\nSo if Maria is the mother, and Maria\u0027s daughter is the child, then:\n- Maria has daughter → Maria\u0027s daughter\n\nSo [Maria][Maria\u0027s daughter] \u003d 10 (\"daughter\")\n\nBut the description says \"daughter\" — so if A has relation \"daughter\" to B → A is daughter of B? That would be backwards.\n\nBut attribute name is \"daughter\", likely meaning \"is daughter of\".\n\nSo if [i][j] \u003d 10 → i is daughter of j.\n\nTherefore, for Maria to be the parent, we need [Maria\u0027s daughter][Maria] \u003d 10 → Maria\u0027s daughter is daughter of Maria.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Maria performs the activity of boating → [Maria][boat (activity)] \u003d 8 (\"perform\")\n- Maria\u0027s daughter performs boating → [Maria\u0027s daughter][boat (activity)] \u003d 8\n- The activity \"boat\" takes place on a lake → so lake is context? Or location.\n\nBut there\u0027s no \"on\" relation. Available spatial: \"under\", \"above\", \"attached\".\n\n\"on\" is not directly supported.\n\nBut \"on\" can be interpreted as \"above\", if we assume the boat is above the lake surface.\n\nSo [boat (object)][lake] \u003d 7 (\"above\")\n\nBut we don\u0027t have \"on\" or \"in\".\n\nAlternatively, we can use \"context\"? But context is for type, not relation.\n\nWait, \"context\" is a type for an entry, not a relation.\n\nWait, the type codes are for matrix entries.\n\n- 2: \"context\" — identityMapping\u003dtrue → can only be on diagonal.\nSo a node can be of type \"context\", meaning it\u0027s a contextual element, like environment.\n\nSo \"lake\" could be of type \"context\".\n\nBut then relation between activity and lake?\n\nWe have no \"at\" or \"in\" relation.\n\nOptions for relation: are they connected?\n\nWe might say:\n- The activity \"boat\" happens at the lake → so we need a relation from activity to lake.\n\nBut no \"at\" or \"target\" might be used?\n\n\"target\" (ID 9) — could mean the object of an action, but \"boating on a lake\" — lake is location, not target.\n\nAlternatively, can we treat the lake as the context of the activity?\n\nBut the matrix can only have relations with identityMapping\u003dfalse outside diagonal.\n\nSo we cannot use \"context\" as a relation — only as a node type.\n\nWe have no relation for location.\n\nBut we have:\n- 5: attached\n- 6: under\n- 7: above\n- 8: perform\n- 9: target\n- 10: daughter\n- 14: characteristic\n\nNone directly mean \"on\", \"at\", or \"in\".\n\nBut \"above\" might be acceptable if we assume the boat is above the water.\n\nBut what about the activity? The activity is abstract.\n\nPerhaps the physical object \"boat\" is above the lake.\n\nBut the activity \"boating\" is performed by people and related to the object and location.\n\nAnother approach:\n- Maria and her daughter are in/on the boat → so they are \"on\" the boat → again \"above\"?\n\nBut if they\u0027re in the boat, they are not above, but inside.\n\nNo \"in\" relation.\n\n\"attached\"? Could mean connected.\n\nBut not ideal.\n\nProblem: There is no \"on\", \"in\", \"at\", or \"located\" relation in the type codes.\n\nThis is a severe limitation.\n\nBut let\u0027s see what we can map.\n\nWe must represent:\n1. Maria → is a person → type: object\n2. Maria\u0027s daughter → person → type: object or context?\n3. Maria has daughter Maria\u0027s daughter → use relation 10: daughter → [Maria\u0027s daughter][Maria] \u003d 10? No.\n\nIf [i][j] \u003d 10 → i is daughter of j.\n\nSo for \"Maria\u0027s daughter is daughter of Maria\", we set [i][j] \u003d 10 where i \u003d index of \"Maria\u0027s daughter\", j \u003d index of \"Maria\".\n\nYes.\n\n4. Maria performs boating → [Maria][boat_activity] \u003d 8\n5. Maria\u0027s daughter performs boating → [daughter][boat_activity] \u003d 8\n6. The boating happens on the lake → need a relation between boat_activity and lake? Or between boat_object and lake?\n\nBut \"boat\" as activity is abstract. It occurs at a location.\n\nBut no relation for location.\n\nAlternatively, can we say the lake is the context of the entire scene?\n\nSo lake → type: context\n\nBut still need relation?\n\nNo — the context type is only for the node type (diagonal), not for relation.\n\nSo the lake can be marked as a context node, but there must be a relation to connect it to the activity.\n\nBut no available relation.\n\n\"target\" (ID 9)? — \"Maria boats on the lake\" — is the lake the target? Not really; the activity is done on/with the boat, at the lake.\n\n\"attached\"? e.g., boat attached to lake? Not physically.\n\n\"above\": if boat (object) is above the lake, then [boat_object][lake] \u003d 7 → boat is above lake.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nAnd for the people, they are in the boat → so [Maria][boat_object] \u003d ? — no \"in\", no \"on\" except \"above\" or \"attached\".\n\n\"attached\" might work — people are attached to the boat (riding it).\n\nSo [Maria][boat_object] \u003d 5 (\"attached\") — Maria is attached to the boat.\n\nSimilarly for daughter.\n\nBut we don\u0027t have the boat object explicitly in the query. The query says \"fahren Boot\", which includes the object.\n\nBut \"Boot\" is used in \"fahren Boot\", so it\u0027s part of the activity description.\n\nBut in the vocabulary, we should include the boat as an object.\n\nYes, because otherwise we cannot relate the people to anything physical.\n\nSo we must include \"boat\" as an object.\n\nSo entities:\n- Maria (object)\n- Maria\u0027s daughter (object)\n- boat (object) — the vessel\n- lake (context) — or object? Let\u0027s see.\n\n\"Context\" type is allowed on diagonal, so lake can be \"context\".\n\nBut we also need to relate.\n\nNow for the activity of boating — is it necessary?\n\nThe activity \"boat\" is derived from the verb.\n\nBut we can possibly omit the activity node and just use the object and the spatial relations?\n\nBut the query is about an activity — \"fahren\", so we should represent the action.\n\nAnd we have \"perform\" relation.\n\nSo better to include the activity.\n\nSo vocabulary:\n1. Maria\n2. Maria\u0027s daughter\n3. boat (object)\n4. lake\n5. boat (activity)\n\nWait — two \"boat\"s? But same word, different types.\n\nBut the vocabulary should have distinct entries.\n\nWe can name them clearly:\n- \"Maria\"\n- \"Maria\u0027s daughter\"\n- \"vessel: boat\"\n- \"lake\"\n- \"activity: boat\"\n\nBut the rule says: \"Einträge des Vokabulars müssen zwingend in Englisch angegeben werden.\" — so English terms.\n\nBut they must be meaningful.\n\nPossible vocabulary:\n- \"Maria\"\n- \"Maria\u0027s daughter\"\n- \"boat\"\n- \"lake\"\n- \"boating\"\n\nTo distinguish, but both \"boat\" and \"boating\" — but \"boating\" is not in the original, but acceptable as verbal form.\n\nBut rule: \"Verallgemeinere Wortstämme\" — use base form. For activity, use verb base form: \"boat\".\n\nSo activity: \"boat\"\n\nBut conflict with object \"boat\".\n\nWe need to disambiguate.\n\nBut the system may allow duplicate words with different types.\n\nBut better to avoid.\n\nAlternative: use \"the boat\" and \"to boat\"? But vocabulary is just terms.\n\nPerhaps accept that \"boat\" appears twice, but in context, different indices.\n\nBut better to use:\n- \"Maria\"\n- \"Maria\u0027s daughter\"\n- \"boat\"\n- \"lake\"\n- \"activity_boat\"\n\nBut not natural.\n\nOr use synonym? But no.\n\nPerhaps the activity can be inferred from \"fahren\", but \"fahren Boot\" is idiomatic for \"go boating\".\n\nSo the activity is \"boating\", but base form \"boat\" as verb.\n\nBut to distinguish, we\u0027ll use:\n- \"boat\" for object\n- \"to boat\" for activity? But not in English list.\n\nThe vocabulary should be simple English words.\n\nAnd the task says: \"Übersetze die ermittelten Stichwörter ins Englische.\"\n\nOriginal keywords: Tochter, ich, fahren, Boot, See\n\n→ daughter, Maria, boat (verb), boat (noun), lake\n\nBut \"fahren\" is \"drive\", but in \"Boot fahren\" it means \"go boating\".\n\nSo better: \"go boating\" → activity is \"boat\".\n\nBut duplicate.\n\nIn semantic networks, homonyms are allowed with different roles.\n\nSo we\u0027ll have two entries: \"boat\" as object, \"boat\" as activity.\n\nWith different types.\n\nNow matrix:\n\nLet\u0027s assign indices:\n\n0: \"Maria\" → type: object (ID 1)\n1: \"Maria\u0027s daughter\" → type: object (ID 1)\n2: \"boat\" (object) → type: object (ID 1)\n3: \"lake\" → type: context (ID 2) [since it\u0027s a location, environmental]\n4: \"boat\" (activity) → type: activity (ID 4)\n\nNow relations:\n\n- Maria is the parent, Maria\u0027s daughter is daughter of Maria → so [1][0] \u003d 10 (\"daughter\")\n- Maria performs boating → [0][4] \u003d 8 (\"perform\")\n- Maria\u0027s daughter performs boating → [1][4] \u003d 8\n- The boat (object) is above the lake → [2][3] \u003d 7 (\"above\")\n- Maria is attached to the boat? Or on/in it → use \"attached\" (ID 5) → [0][2] \u003d 5\n- Similarly, Maria\u0027s daughter attached to boat → [1][2] \u003d 5\n\nDo we need a relation between activity and object? Such as \"boating\" uses \"boat\"?\n\nBut no \"uses\", \"has\", or \"target\" might be usable.\n\n\"target\" (ID 9) — could mean the object of the action.\n\n\"Maria boats [the boat]\" — but \"boat\" as verb doesn\u0027t take an object that way.\n\n\"boat\" as in \"to travel by boat\", so the boat is the instrument.\n\nBut no \"instrument\" relation.\n\n\"attached\"? But it\u0027s a conceptual link.\n\nNo direct type.\n\nBut perhaps not necessary. The activity might stand alone.\n\nBut the scene has the physical boat.\n\nAnother option: omit the activity node and just use the object and the people being attached to it and on the lake.\n\nBut the action \"fahrend\" implies an ongoing activity, so better to include it.\n\nBut let\u0027s check if we can represent without it.\n\nBut the user said \"fahrend\", so it\u0027s an action.\n\nAnd we have \"perform\" relation, so include activity.\n\nNow, is there a relation from the activity to the location?\n\nNo.\n\nBetween activity and object?\n\nNo.\n\nBut we can link the activity to the object via synonym? But synonym is identityMapping\u003dtrue, so only on diagonal, not for relations.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo we cannot express that the activity \"boat\" involves the object \"boat\".\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps it\u0027s acceptable, as the names are the same.\n\nBut in the matrix, they are different nodes.\n\nSo we need a relation.\n\nBut no available relation.\n\n\"characteristic\"? ID 14 — means \"has characteristic\", but not for actions.\n\n\"attached\"? ID 5 — but it\u0027s for physical connectedness.\n\nCould we say the activity is attached to the boat object? Not really.\n\nNo good mapping.\n\nPerhaps use \"target\": the activity of boating targets the boat? That doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nOr targets the lake? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the activity \"boat\" has the lake as context, but again, no \"has context\" relation.\n\nAnd we can\u0027t use \"context\" as a relation because identityMapping\u003dtrue, only for diagonal.\n\nSo only options for off-diagonal are: 5,6,7,8,9,10,14 — all identityMapping\u003dfalse.\n\nNone of which clearly mean \"involves\", \"uses\", \"at\", etc.\n\n\"attached\" might be stretched to mean associated.\n\nBut it\u0027s weak.\n\n\"daughter\" is used for kinship — not relevant.\n\nSo we are missing crucial relations.\n\nBut let\u0027s see if we can proceed with what we have.\n\nWe have:\n- People: Maria, Maria\u0027s daughter\n- Object: boat\n- Location: lake\n- Activity: boat\n\nRelations we can express:\n- [1][0] \u003d 10 (daughter of)\n- [0][4] \u003d 8 (Maria performs boating)\n- [1][4] \u003d 8 (daughter performs boating)\n- [0][2] \u003d 5 (Maria attached to boat)\n- [1][2] \u003d 5 (daughter attached to boat)\n- [2][3] \u003d 7 (boat above lake)\n\nThe activity \"boating\" is not linked to the boat object or to the lake.\n\nBut the scene is \"boating on a lake\", so lake should be linked to activity.\n\nCould we use \"above\" between activity and lake? No, activity is abstract.\n\n\"target\": the boating activity has the lake as its target? No.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps the boat object is the target of the activity? But the activity is boating, which involves the boat, but not \"targeting\" it.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAlternative: omit the activity node.\n\nThen we only have objects and relations.\n\nBut the action \"fahren\" must be represented.\n\nWithout an activity node, how?\n\nWe can use the relations themselves to imply activity.\n\nFor example, if people are attached to a boat, and the boat is above a lake, and they are in motion — but not specified.\n\nBut the vocabulary must include the activity, as per the query.\n\nAccording to the rules, we must have a node for each keyword.\n\nKeywords: Tochter, ich, fahren, Boot, See\n\n\"fahren\" is the activity.\n\nSo must include.\n\nBut we cannot properly link it.\n\nMoreover, no relation type for \"on\" or \"at\".\n\nThis suggests that the required relations are not covered by the given type codes.\n\nSpecifically:\n- No relation for location (at, on, in)\n- No relation for instrument or means\n- No relation between activity and location\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to fully represent the scene with the given type codes.\n\nThus, we must return an error.\n\nBut let\u0027s double-check if there is a workaround.\n\nPerhaps \"context\" can be used in a binary relation? But no, identityMapping\u003dtrue, so only allowed on diagonal.\n\nRule: Einträge außerhalb Einheitsdiagonalen nur mit identityMapping\u003d\u003dfalse.\n\nSo \"context\" (ID 2) has identityMapping\u003dtrue, so cannot be used in relation (off-diagonal).\n\nSimilarly, \"object\", \"activity\", \"synonym\" are only for diagonal.\n\nSo only relational types are 5,6,7,8,9,10,14.\n\nAmong these:\n- 5: attached — general connection\n- 6: under\n- 7: above\n- 8: perform\n- 9: target\n- 10: daughter\n- 14: characteristic\n\nFor \"on\", we can use \"above\" as approximation — already used for boat above lake.\n\nFor people on boat, we used \"attached\".\n\nFor the activity, we have no way to link it to the location.\n\nBut perhaps we can say the activity is targeted at the lake? No.\n\nOr the lake is a characteristic of the activity? No.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: use \"context\" on the diagonal for the lake, and then no off-diagonal relation needed? But that doesn\u0027t connect it.\n\nThe matrix entries are only for relations between two terms.\n\nTo have the scene complete, the activity must be related to the location.\n\nSince there is no suitable ID for that relation, per rule: if no matching type code, return error.\n\nSimilarly, for the boat object being the instrument of the activity, no relation.\n\nSo multiple missing relations.\n\nTherefore, cannot create valid GraphCode.\n\nError.\n\nBut let\u0027s see if \"target\" can be used.\n\nIf the activity \"boat\" targets the lake, that might imply doing it at the lake.\n\nBut \"target\" usually means objective, not location.\n\nFor example, \"attack the city\" — city is target.\n\n\"Boat on the lake\" — lake is not the target.\n\nSo not appropriate.\n\n\"characteristic\": the activity has the characteristic lake? No.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that not all relations can be mapped to the provided type codes.\n\nHence, error.\n\nTask 7: Überprüfe, ob es für alle diese Relationen einen Eintrag gibt.\n\nRequired relations:\n- Maria --daughter--\u003e Maria\u0027s daughter (via [daughter][Maria]\u003d10) — YES\n- Maria --performs--\u003e boating — YES (ID 8)\n- daughter --performs--\u003e boating — YES\n- boat (object) --above--\u003e lake — YES (ID 7)\n- Maria --attached--\u003e boat (object) — YES (ID 5)\n- daughter --attached--\u003e boat (object) — YES\n\nMissing:\n- boating --[location]--\u003e lake → no type for location\n- boating --[involves]--\u003e boat (object) → no type for instrument\n\nSo at least two relations cannot be expressed.\n\nThus, error.\n\nFinal output.\n\n{\n  \"error\": \"Es konnte nicht für alle Beziehungen zwischen den Stichwörtern ein entsprechender Typcode gefunden werden.\",\n  \"description\": \"Die Anfrage enthält Beziehungen, für die keine passenden Typkodierungen existieren.
