However, since there is no direct \"owned by\" relationship in the typology, I used the closest match, which is `target` (10), to indicate that the pool is the target of Maria\u0027s ownership.\n  - All diagonal entries are filled with the appropriate types where `identityMapping \u003d\u003d true`.\n  - Other entries are either 0 or have valid relationships based on the provided typology."
