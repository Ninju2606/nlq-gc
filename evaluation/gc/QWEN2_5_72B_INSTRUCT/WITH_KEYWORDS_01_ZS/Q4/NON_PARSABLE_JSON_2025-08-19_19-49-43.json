Therefore, the relationship between Maria and the pool is indicated by the `target` relationship (9), which suggests that Maria owns the pool.\n- **Pool** (Index 3) is an **object**, hence the matrix entry at (3,3) is `1`.\n\nThe relationship \"Maria performs swim\" is represented by the matrix entry at (0,1) with `8`, but since \"own\" is used to specify Maria\u0027s ownership of the pool, the relationship between Maria and the pool is represented by the matrix entry at (0,3) and (3,0) with `9`.\n\nSince the word \"own\" is not explicitly defined in the matrix, the relationship is represented indirectly through the `target` relationship. However, if the relationship was more complex or if there was no suitable indirect representation, an error would be generated."
