So, `\"maria\"` is an object (`1`), `\"swim\"` is an activity (`4`), `\"own\"` is an object (`1`), and `\"pool\"` is an object (`1`).\n  - For the relationship between `\"maria\"` and `\"swim\"`, we use the `perform` relation (`8`), indicating that Maria is performing the activity of swimming.\n  - For the relationship between `\"swim\"` and `\"pool\"`, we use the `in` relation (`6`), indicating that the activity of swimming is happening in the pool.\n  - The word `\"own\"` is included in the dictionary but does not have a direct relation to any other term in the given context, so its matrix entries remain `0`. If there were a more specific relation, it would be included, but since it\u0027s not directly relevant to the current scene, it is not used.\n\nThis GraphCode accurately represents the user\u0027s query \"Ich schwimme in meinem Pool\" while adhering to the specified rules and constraints."
